# Writing Requirements Effectively 

## Overview 

The heart of the **Agile mindset** is simple: **do the right things, and do things right**. 
At this stage, focus on defining requirements at the **business level**—avoid technical details.   
All **Feature Requirements** should include **Specification by Example** scenario tables. These help create clear, testable acceptance criteria align with BDD principle.   
> [!note]    
> BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) is mainly used for acceptance tests. 

## Prerequisites 
For more background, see:

- [Business Requirement Definition](../../2025-12-08_BusinessReqDef/README.md)

## Procedure 
Requirements are created following the approach in [Business Requirement Definition](https://github.com/retamotome/SelfDirectedTraining/blob/main/AgileSoftwareEngineering/2025-12-08_BusinessReqDef/README.md). Each requirement should include tables (see the [requirement template](../../templates/Feature-Requirement-Template.txt)) which be presented using the method from [Specification by Example](https://www.tenlong.com.tw/products/9789862019481): 
- **Risk and Solution** 
- **Normal Case** 
- **Error Handling** 

These tables are then used to generate **acceptance** test cases in a **pseudocode-like** format, such as [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/). Today, these can be run directly as tests using supported frameworks. This approach predates the term *“Vibe Coding”*. 
In the **Identification** phase of [Business Requirement Definition](https://github.com/retamotome/SelfDirectedTraining/blob/main/AgileSoftwareEngineering/2025-12-08_BusinessReqDef/README.md), use **5W1H** (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) to clarify each requirement table. These are then expressed in pseudocode-like syntax, as shown below, to serve as corresponding **acceptance** test cases for the requirement. 

### Pseudocode-Like Syntax Example (Gherkin) 

``` 
Feature: Brief description of what is needed 
   In order to achieve a business value 
   As a system actor 
   I want to gain a beneficial outcome 

   Scenario: A specific business situation 
      Given some precondition 
         And another precondition 
      When an action occurs 
         And another action 
      Then a testable outcome is achieved 
         And another result can be checked 

   Scenario: Another situation 
      ... 

``` 

These acceptance test cases can be executed:    
* using supported frameworks,    
* integrated into CI/CD pipelines, or    
* automated with code-then-run AI agents.   
 

> [!note]   
> While Gherkin is used as an example here, you are not restricted to any specific language or syntax. Use whatever format is clear and effective for your team.   
> Likewise, when generating code for tests, you may use C++, Python, or any language you prefer.
